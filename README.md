You invested $100.000 in SpaceX mission projects.

Every time a new rocket model is invented new investors will fund SpaceX rising the value of your investment by +30%,

New models aren't released very often and the return of investment strictly depends from the success of the launch,

Every time it is a success you will gain 12% , on the other hand you can lose 60% if it is a fail + 3% for each previous failed mission.

Sometimes SpaceX will "reuse" spare components used in previous missions, in case of a successful mission investors predict an extra 4% gain for each component reused.

Write a program in php or python that prints out a missions report sorted from most recent at the top and oldest at bottom:

On each print:
Name of the rocket , Launch status, gain/loss percentage, balance of your investment.

Use class object notation.

You can fetch data at: https://api.spacexdata.com/v2/launches

Everthing was made in PHP with some JS code.

Thank you. 

and remember: "Pressure turns coal into diamonds!".
